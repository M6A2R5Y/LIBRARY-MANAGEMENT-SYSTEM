# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
In this repo am going to upload my day-to-day progress in building a working library management system.
We will need Apache NetBeans for building and coding in Java, MySQL community edition for building a database and XAMPP for hosting the server locally.
Hope you find it helpful and enjoyable.
LETS GET TO BUILDING

IMPORTANT!!!
Make sure you install the following programs into your machine:
1. XAMPP
2. MySQL community edition
3. Apache NetBeans(for my case am using version 12.5)
4. Java development kit (also configure the path appropriately)
5. Visual Studio Code (optional)
